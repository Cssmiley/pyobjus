Welcome to Pyobjus
==================

Pyobjus is a Python library for accessing Objective-C class. If you want to
access Java class, look at `Pyjnius
<http://pyjnius.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

This documentation is divided into differents parts. We recommend you to start
with :ref:`installation`, and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`. If
you'd rather dive into the internals of Pyobjus, check out the :ref:`api`
documentation.
